# Overview
This is the frontend component of a movie management application built with React. The frontend provides a user interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting movies, and also handles user authentication and session management. The application communicates with the backend API to retrieve and manipulate data.

# Setup
To run the frontend component of the application, you will need to have Node.js (version 12 or later) and NPM (version 6 or later) installed on your system. You can then follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the frontend directory.
Install the required packages by running npm install.
Start the frontend server by running npm start.
The frontend server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

# Usage
To use the application, you can open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/users/new. You will be presented with a login screen where you can enter your username. After logging in, your username is added to the database and you can create movies wunder it. You are required to provide a username every time you add a movie.

From this screen, you can create new movies, view existing movies, update movie details, and delete movies. You can also log out of the application by clicking the logout button.
